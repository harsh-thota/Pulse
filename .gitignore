# This .gitignore file is for CMake projects.
# It is designed to ignore all common generated build artifacts,
# including IDE-specific files, to keep your repository clean.

# ===============================================
# CMake Generated Files and Directories
# ===============================================
# The 'build' directory is the standard location for out-of-source builds.
# The 'out' directory is also a common choice.
# The 'cmake-build-*' pattern catches directories created by CLion.

# ===============================================
# IDE-specific Files and Folders
# ===============================================
# The '.vs/' directory is created by Visual Studio and should always be ignored.
# If this folder was committed previously, you must remove it from the repository
# using 'git rm --cached .vs/' before this rule will take effect.
